# AWS Amplify DataStore Docs

**TODO: figure out relative links that change w/ code changes**

[Amplify DataStore](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/datastore/getting-started/q/platform/js/) provides a programming model for leveraging shared and distributed data without writing additional code for offline and online scenarios, which makes working with distributed, cross-user data just as simple as working with local-only data.

Before you start reading through these docs, take a moment to understand [how DataStore works at a high level](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/datastore/how-it-works/q/platform/js/). Additionally, we recommend first reading through [the DataStore docs](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/datastore/getting-started/q/platform/js/). The purpose of these docs is to dive deep into the codebase itself and understand the inner workings of DataStore for the purpose of contributing. Understanding these docs is **not** necessary for using DataStore.
